# 📊 Linear Regression – A Fundamental Approach to Predictive Modeling

## 🔍 Overview

**Linear Regression** is one of the most fundamental and widely used algorithms in supervised machine learning. It models the relationship between one or more independent variables (features) and a continuous dependent variable (target) by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Linear Regression** model applied to a real-world dataset (e.g., house prices), as part of **Task 1** for the **Skill Craft Technology Internship**.

## 📚 What is Linear Regression?

Linear Regression estimates the relationship between variables by fitting a line (or hyperplane) that best describes how the dependent variable changes with respect to the independent variable(s).

### 📈 Equation of a Simple Linear Regression:
y = β₀ + β₁x + ε
Where:
- `y` = dependent variable (e.g., house price)
- `x` = independent variable (e.g., square footage)
- `β₀` = intercept
- `β₁` = coefficient/slope
- `ε` = error term

For **Multiple Linear Regression**, the model generalizes to:
y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ + ε
